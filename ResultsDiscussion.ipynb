    "Reports should have a __narrative__. Once you've looked through all your results over the quarter, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Include the detailed code and analysis results of those points only; you should spend more time/code/plots on your main point than the others.\n",

Consider deleting things that are not important to your narrative.  If its slightly relevant to the narrative or you just want us to know you tried something, you could keep it in by summarizing the result in this report in a sentence or two, moving the actual analysis to another file in your repo, and providing us a link to that file.\n",

    "After working through this project, we've realized that, ultimately, unsupervised algorithms were not that great for this dataset. This checks out with what we suspected before we began: unsupervised algorithms perform far worse than supervised algorithms for image recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "While our supervised models such as SVM and CNN gave us great results, our unsupervised algorithms such as Gaussian Mixture Models and K-Means gave us poor performance. Unsurprisingly, the CNN gave us the best performance, with SVM coming in at second. This was expected, as CNN algorithms already have a reputation for being strong algorithms for image processing."

    "\n",
    "Our American Sign Language recognition research project utilises the MNIST dataset of hand signs. Even though this dataset has been fairly corroborated and extensively updated over the years; since our project has an application in helping the \"hard of hearing\", it's necessary to consider some possible ethical concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clustering Algorithm Bias: The MNIST training data might lack diversity in hand shapes, skin tones, signing styles, or individual variations, resulting in the algorithm prioritising majority patterns, leading to inaccurate classifications for underrepresented groups. For instance, a dataset skewed towards younger signers might struggle with recognizing signs used more frequently by older adults. In addition to this, even with a perfect algorithm also, there might be implicit biases in the dataset which are being amplified by our clustering algorithm.For example, the data might contain more examples of right-handed signing, potentially impacting the model's ability to recognize signs performed with the left hand. While such conclusions are less often, they are important to take under consideration because the implications of such biases are significant. Misclassifications can lead to communication breakdowns, and misunderstandings, all of which on an extended period and a larger sample space may even lead to social exclusion for specific groups within the Deaf community. We aim to address these concerns by trialling and testing the usage of different clustering algorithms to mitigate the risk of false clustering. Hierarchical clustering, for instance, builds a hierarchy of clusters, allowing me to zoom in on specific signing styles or hand shapes potentially underrepresented in the data. Similarly, density-based methods like DBSCAN focus on identifying clusters based on data density, making them less susceptible to the influence of majority patterns that could amplify bias. By evaluating these alternative algorithms with diverse test sets and fairness metrics (accuracy, precision and F1 score), we will choose the model that best balances inclusivity and accuracy, ensuring equitable representation across all user groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Privacy Issue: The MNIST Hand Sign dataset we are utilising contains 27,455 cases of test data. These are real-life pictures collected from different thousands of different people. Now, in high-security stakes, hand-pictures also serve as identifiers. Due to this reason, similar to any other dataset, our MNIST ASL dataset is also subject to the protection of the privacy of individuals. In addition to this, we will also have input data from voluntary non-ASL communicators to test the real-time interpretation feature of the app. We hope to address this by keeping the identity of the volunteers undisclosed. In addition, we do it by utilising a \"black-box\" way of allowing the user to interact with the model. Without giving them any information about existing ASL hand signs, we hope to test the model for its accuracy in identifying any or all signs that people make, closest to an actual ASL sign.\n",
