    "Our group originally came across Google’s “American Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition” Kaggle competition <a name=\"one\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#onenote) while brainstorming for ideas for our project. We were intrigued by this idea as we were all interested in ML image processing in the first place, but the combination of making advancements in accessibility and image processing only solidified this topic as something we wanted to pursue for our final project. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After some further research, we realized that although we were intrigued by the idea of mixing ML and ASL together, only one of us had prior experience with the MediaPipe library. As many prior writeups regarding the utilization of ML utilized the aforementioned MediaPipe library <a name=\"two\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#twonote) <a name=\"three\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#threenote), we decided to pivot towards the Sign Language MNIST dataset <a name=\"four\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#fournote) in order to make the project more digestible for ourselves. Previous studies have shown that using image recognition platforms in order to recognize ASL have already been successful, with an October 2023 study achieving 98.98% test accuracy <a name=\"five\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#fivenote) and an August 2022 study utilizing MediaPipe, Keras, and the Sign Language MNIST dataset achieving 95% training accuracy <a name=\"three\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#threenote). \n",

    "The problem we are aiming to solve is the classification of ASL characters to provide an ability of communication from deaf people to those who do not understand ASL. With the 27,455 available training data samples, and 7172 samples allocated for testing, we can quantify the success rate by taking the proportion of correct classifications against incorrect classifications. Additionally, we plan to test our clusters by inputting test cases from making the signs on our webcams and observing if the results share a similar accuracy with the test data. This can be replicated as with the publicly available data, one can follow our methods of creating clusters for the data as well as our process in inputting the data from our webcamera."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of clustering ASL (American Sign Language) hand sign images using unsupervised machine learning, supervised machine learning and achieving high accuracy in real-time sign language interpretation through a camera, we have employed the following solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Solution Description***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocessing:\n",
    "    - Resize images to a consistent dimension to ensure uniformity.\n",
    "    - Transform pixel values into 1D array for each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Extraction:\n",
    "    - Utilize a dimensionality reduction technique PCA, to extract essential features and reduce computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unsupervised and Supervised Clustering:\n",
    "    - Apply clustering algortihm such as k-means, GMM, CNN to group similar hand sign images together. (The choice of k can be determined by an Elbow method or Silhouette Score)\n",
    "    - Apply SVM and TensorFlow (Supervised Machine Learning)to correctly predict the sign language and compared accuracy against Unsupervised Methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cluster Label Assigment:\n",
    "    - Assign labels to the clusters based on the majority class of the images within each cluster. (Unsupervised Method)\n",
    "    - Using ground truth labels for our SVM and TensorFlow model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Real-time Sign Language Interpretation:\n",
    "    - Use a camera to capture frames in real-time.\n",
    "    - Preprocess each frame similarly to the training data.\n",
    "    - Apply the trained clustering model to assign a cluster label to the current frame.\n",
    "    - Map the cluster label to the corresponding ASL letter using the assigned labels from the training phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Testing and Validation:\n",
    "    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "    - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the clustering model's performance on the testing set.\n",
    "    - For real-time interpretation, validate the accuracy by comparing the predicted letters to the ground truth ASL letters in a controlled environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Benchmark Model:\n",

This model has being imported into test.py to predict in real-life hand sign throw the webcam\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Implementation Details***\n",

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our project mainly focuses on clustering algorithms to identify similar features between different ASL hand sign images, we need to check how efficient our algorithm is in forming these clusters, and how distinct they are from other clusters. To achieve this, the best feature to use is the Adjusted Rand Score. Adjusted Rand Score is a measure of similarity between two clusterings, particularly focusing on pairs that are in agreement - belonging either to different or the same clusters. The score is a ratio of the number of agreeing pairs to the total number of pairs, giving a value between 0 (no agreement) and 1 (perfect agreement). In contrast to the Rand Score, the Adjusted Rand Score, as the name suggests “adjusts” the random score by accounting for clustering by chance. It does this by assigning close to 0 values to random clusterings and 1 for perfect matches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond this, we will also test the model using traditional classification metrics in an adapted manner. After clustering, we assign the most common true label within each cluster to all its points, enabling us to apply metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. This will be done to test the model for its accuracy in producing true and false positives/negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, we will test our model's accuracy to handle real-time hand-sign interpretations. Non-informative ASL communicators will stand in front of the webcam and make one of the many signs. The model will predict the hand sign. This can be done by displaying the model's prediction on a screen in real time or logging the results for later analysis. We will compare the model's real-time predictions with the actual signs being performed to assess accuracy. "

    "\n",
    "OK, you've given us quite a bit of tech informaiton above, now its time to tell us what to pay attention to in all that.  Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",

    "\n",
    "Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our American Sign Language recognition research project utilises the MNIST dataset of hand signs. Even though this dataset has been fairly corroborated and extensively updated over the years; since our project has an application in helping the \"hard of hearing\", it's necessary to consider some possible ethical concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clustering Algorithm Bias: The MNIST training data might lack diversity in hand shapes, skin tones, signing styles, or individual variations, resulting in the algorithm prioritising majority patterns, leading to inaccurate classifications for underrepresented groups. For instance, a dataset skewed towards younger signers might struggle with recognizing signs used more frequently by older adults. In addition to this, even with a perfect algorithm also, there might be implicit biases in the dataset which are being amplified by our clustering algorithm.For example, the data might contain more examples of right-handed signing, potentially impacting the model's ability to recognize signs performed with the left hand. While such conclusions are less often, they are important to take under consideration because the implications of such biases are significant. Misclassifications can lead to communication breakdowns, and misunderstandings, all of which on an extended period and a larger sample space may even lead to social exclusion for specific groups within the Deaf community. We aim to address these concerns by trialling and testing the usage of different clustering algorithms to mitigate the risk of false clustering. Hierarchical clustering, for instance, builds a hierarchy of clusters, allowing me to zoom in on specific signing styles or hand shapes potentially underrepresented in the data. Similarly, density-based methods like DBSCAN focus on identifying clusters based on data density, making them less susceptible to the influence of majority patterns that could amplify bias. By evaluating these alternative algorithms with diverse test sets and fairness metrics (accuracy, precision and F1 score), we will choose the model that best balances inclusivity and accuracy, ensuring equitable representation across all user groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Privacy Issue: The MNIST Hand Sign dataset we are utilising contains 27,455 cases of test data. These are real-life pictures collected from different thousands of different people. Now, in high-security stakes, hand-pictures also serve as identifiers. Due to this reason, similar to any other dataset, our MNIST ASL dataset is also subject to the protection of the privacy of individuals. In addition to this, we will also have input data from voluntary non-ASL communicators to test the real-time interpretation feature of the app. We hope to address this by keeping the identity of the volunteers undisclosed. In addition, we do it by utilising a \"black-box\" way of allowing the user to interact with the model. Without giving them any information about existing ASL hand signs, we hope to test the model for its accuracy in identifying any or all signs that people make, closest to an actual ASL sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
