    "\n",
    "Being provided with a dataset of many characters in American Sign Language, we thought it would be interesting to utilize many of the clustering techniques taught in this course to generate clusters of the ASL characters and from there, have our models be optimized enough to be able to use our web camera and create our own signs, the model should be able to correctly assign it to a cluster and return the character. Our data is represented as a vector of pixel intensities that range from 0-255 (single dimensional as it is greyscale). With this, we would run a clustering algorithm on the greyscale images. Next, assuming the clusters are accurate, we would transform our webcam image with a student forming a sign, and input the greyscale image into our clustering algorithm where it would then identify the proper character. To measure performance, we would allocate a portion of the dataset for testing and based off the proportion of correct classifications vs incorrect classifications, we would return an accuracy percentage."

    "\n",
    "Our group originally came across Google’s “American Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition” Kaggle competition <a name=\"Ashleynote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Ashley) while brainstorming for ideas for our project. We were intrigued by this idea as we were all interested in ML image processing in the first place, but the combination of making advancements in accessibility and image processing only solidified this topic as something we wanted to pursue for our final project. \n",
    "\n",
    "After some further research, we realized that although we were intrigued by the idea of mixing ML and ASL together, only one of us had prior experience with the MediaPipe library. As many prior writeups regarding the utilization of ML utilized the aforementioned MediaPipe library <a name=\"ElMoujahid\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#ElMoujahid) <a name=\"Garimella\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#GarimellaNote), we decided to pivot towards the Sign Language MNIST dataset <a name=\"tecperson\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#tecpersonNote) in order to make the project more digestible for ourselves. Previous studies have shown that using image recognition platforms in order to recognize ASL have already been successful, with an October 2023 study achieving 98.98% test accuracy <a name=\"Pathan\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#PathanNote) and an August 2022 study utilizing MediaPipe, Keras, and the Sign Language MNIST dataset achieving 95% training accuracy <a name=\"Garimella\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#GarimellaNote). \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding advancements in what’s been done for machine learning and ASL detection, Google has launched Project Shuwa in the past in order to bring awareness and teach more people about ASL <a name=\"ElMoujahid\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#ElMoujahid). One (of many components) of Project Shuwa is SignTown, an “interactive game that utilizes webcams and a web browser to help people learn about sign language and Deaf culture” <a name=\"ElMoujahid\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#ElMoujahid). Google has also made it easier to learn about both ASL and machine learning through the utilization of their “Teachable Machine” tool, where people can use a no-code approach to leverage machine learning to test a model’s ability to recognize ASL samples <a name=\"Chen\"></a>[<sup>[6]</sup>](#ChenNote)."

    "\n",
    "The problem we are aiming to solve is the classification of ASL characters to provide an ability of communication from deaf people to those who do not understand ASL. With the 27,455 available training data samples, and 7172 samples allocated for testing, we can quantify the success rate by taking the proportion of correct classifications against incorrect classifications. Additionally, we plan to test our clusters by inputting test cases from making the signs on our webcams and observing if the results share a similar accuracy with the test data. This can be replicated as with the publicly available data, one can follow our methods of creating clusters for the data as well as our process in inputting the data from our webcamera."
